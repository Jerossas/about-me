All my real doggs still kick it with me
All my down hoes still tricking with me
All the true gangstas know
Nate ain't never love no ho
All the hoodrats still shake it for me
All my true fans still check it for me
All the real smokers know
Nate ain't passing nothing but dope indeed
Real trees, chronic leaves, no seeds

When I met you last night baby
Before I blew your mind
I thought we had a chance, lady
No more, now that I'm sober you ain't that fine
Don't wanna treat you wrong
Don't wanna lead you on
Here baby, hit the bong
While the west coast rolls along
While we still making gangsta hits
You'll be still jocking gangsta dicks
Damn girl, you think you're slick
Somebody better get this bitch, this bitch
